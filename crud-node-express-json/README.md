CRUD Operations with MERN
=========================

This is a simple example of performing CRUD operations using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing user data.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
-   Express.js: A web application framework for building the server-side API.
-   React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   Node.js: A runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   Install Node.js: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
-   Install MongoDB: [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone <repository_url>`

2.  Install dependencies:

    bashCopy code

    `cd <project_directory>
    npm install`

3.  Start the server:

    bashCopy code

    `npm start`

4.  Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to access the API.

Client-side Integration
-----------------------

To integrate the client-side React application with this API, you can make HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using libraries like `axios` or `fetch`. The client-side routes should correspond to the server-side routes mentioned above.
